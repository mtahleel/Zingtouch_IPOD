# Getting started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:
'npm start', which runs the app in the development mode.
Open: http://localhost:3000 to view it in browser.

We are building an ipod project here.

A modern web gesture detection library 'Zingtouch' has been used in this project to navigate through the list of menu in the sidebar of the screen.

A click event on the center button has been added to go inside the highlighted menu in the sidebar.

Click and hold on the circular div and move over it to scroll.

Various images like previous, next, play/pause etc has been designed
to display themselves on the circular div using absolute position property.

One more click event on the MENU button has been implemented to come back from the inside of list of menu on the sidebar.

Background of the body has been designed using linear gradient.

Responsiveness has been added to the project to view it differently in differnt screen sizes.
